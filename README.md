# About Me

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alejandro, an enthusiastic developer specializing in game and software development residing in Madrid, Spain. I graduated from Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) with a degree in Game Development. Possessing four years of hands-on experience in project development, I'm now eagerly seeking fresh opportunities within the software industry.

I am someone who enjoys learning, thrives in teamwork, is efficient, and excels at problem-solving. 
I am proficient in programming languages such as C#, C++ and Python, and to a lesser extent, JavaScript, Java, HTML and CSS.

I would like to emphasize that I have a B2 level in English, so communication would not be an issue for me, enabling me to contribute effectively to international projects.
I am ready to take on new challenges and continuously learn to expand my skill set.

Looking forward to connecting with you! ðŸ‘‡
